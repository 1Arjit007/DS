Declaration of a pointer variable
data_type *pname;

Assiging Address to a pointer variable
int *iptr,age=30;
iptr = &age;

Dereferencing Pointer Variables
int a = 87
int *p1 = &a;

*p1 = 9; is equivalent to a=9;
(*p1)++; is equivalent to a++;
x = *p1 + 10; is equivalent to x = a +10;
printf("%d",*p1); is equivalent to printf("%d",a);
scanf("%d",p1) is equivalent to scanf("%d",&a);

Pointer to Pointer
data_type **pptr;
int a=5;
int *pa = &a;
int **ppa = &pa;

Pointers and One Dimensional Arrays
*(arr+i) -> arr[i]

Function Returning Pointer
type *func(type1,type2,......)

Array of Pointers
datatype *arrayname[size];
