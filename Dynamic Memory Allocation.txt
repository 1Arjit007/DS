1.malloc()
 declaration : void *malloc(size_t size);
 ptr=(datatype *)malloc(specified size);
 
2.calloc()
   declaration:void *calloc(size_t n,size_t size);
   equivalent code
   ptr=(int *)calloc(5,sizeof(int));
   ptr=(int *)malloc(5*sizeof(int));
   difference:
  1.Calloc takes two arguments.The first arguments specifies the number of blocks and second one specifies the size of each block.
  2.The other difference between calloc() and malloc() is hat the memory allocated by malloc() contains garbage value while the memory allocated by calloc() is initialized to zero.
   similarilties:
   like malloc,calloc() also returns NULL if there is not sufficient memory available in the heap.
   
3.realloc()
   declaration:void *realloc(void *ptr,size_t newsize);
   The function realloc() is used to change the size of the memory block.It alters the size of the memory block without losing old data.
   This function takes two arguments,first is a pointer to the block of memory that was previously allocated by malloc() or calloc()
   and second one is he new size for that block.for example-
   ptr=(int *)malloc(size);
   ptr=(int *)realloc(ptr,newsize);
   
4.free()
   Declaration:void free(void *p);
